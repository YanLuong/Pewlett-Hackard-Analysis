# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

### Background

Pewlett Hackard is a large company employing several thousands of people. The company has been around for a long time with a large number of its workforce facing retirement. Pewlett Hackard needs to plan ahead to minimize the impact of retiring staff and unfilled vacancies.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine which positions will need to be filled as thousands of employees retire. Bobby who is a HR analyst, will need to answer the following questions: 1) How many employees will be retiring soon per title? and 2) Who will be eligible to participate in mentorship program?. Bobby's goal is to generate a list of upcoming employees who will be eligible for retirement package. The data is currently only stored in CSV formats as the company has been using mainly Excel and VBA to work with the data. Instead of using the current method, they have decided to upgrade to using SQL to handle the large volume of data. We will help Bobby build an employee SQL database which will allow us to use queries to pull out relevant data.
